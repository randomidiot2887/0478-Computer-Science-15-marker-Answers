# Question 1

__**May June 2025 Region 1**__

The one-dimensional (1D) array `CompetitorName[]` contains the names of 25 competitors in a
tournament that includes five events.


Another two-dimensional (2D) array `CompetitorScore[]` contains the points scored by each
competitor in the five events. 


The first dimension of this array contains the index of the competitor from `CompetitorName[]` and the second dimension contains their scores.


Each competitor receives a score out of 100 for each event. These scores are manually entered into `CompetitorScore[]`


Medals are awarded to the competitor or the competitors who have:
- the highest points scored in each of the five events
- the highest total points scored for all five events.


The one-dimensional (1D) array Points[] stores the total number of points scored for each
competitor.

__Write a program that meets the following requirements:__
- takes as input, valid scores **(between 0 and 100)**, for each competitor in each of the five events
- calculates the highest points scored for each event
- outputs the names of the competitors who receive a medal for the highest points scored
- calculates the highest total points scored for the five events
- outputs the names of the competitors with the highest total points scored for the five events.

You must use **pseudocode or program code** and add comments to explain how your code works.

You do not need to declare any arrays or variables.

All inputs and outputs must contain suitable messages.
